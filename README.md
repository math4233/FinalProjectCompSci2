# FinalProjectCompSci2
This project essentially informs the user about the world of IT and its many different fields especially today, when there is conflicting information and resources, there needs to be a sort of standard to not confuse people. This program approaches that by how it provides resources and descriptions of said fields and making it easier to digest for people who may not have the know-how in the industry. 

To run and compile this project:
1. I used CodeBlocks as it was easier and I didn't have to fight with linker issues, I also used GNU GCC as my compiler.
CodeBlocks download -> https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/
2. Download or Clone the repository.
3. Load CodeBlocks and open a project.
4. Open the "CS2FinalProject" project file in the "CS2FinalProject" folder.
5. When it opens, go to the "Project" tab on the top of the window.
6. Click it, and then click "Automatic source paths...".
7. Click "Add".
8. Click the folder icon on the right of the text box underneath "Path".
9. Click on "include" folder and then click "Select Folder".
10. Click "OK".
11. Repeat again, and instead of "include", click the "src" folder.
12. Click "OK" to exit.
13. The program should be ready to compile at that point.
